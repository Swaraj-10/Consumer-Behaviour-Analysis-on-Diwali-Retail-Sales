# Diwali Sales Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Diwali Sales, focused on identifying consumer behaviour patterns, top-performing segments, and actionable business insights. The analysis uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to study purchase trends across gender, age group, state, occupation, and product categories.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how different customer demographics behave during the Diwali shopping season. By analyzing more than fifty thousand transaction records, this project extracts meaningful insights that can help businesses improve their targeting, inventory planning, and marketing strategies.

The analysis covers data cleaning, transformation, segmentation, visualization, and final conclusions grounded in evidence.

## Objectives

- Process and clean the raw sales dataset  
- Explore customer demographics and their buying patterns  
- Identify the most profitable states, occupations, and age groups  
- Analyze product categories and spending behaviour  
- Summarize data-driven business insights  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Data Preparation

Several preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the dataset for analysis:

- Removal of redundant or irrelevant columns  
- Handling missing values  
- Type conversion of numerical fields such as Amount and Orders  
- Standardization of categorical variables  
- Filtering invalid entries and duplicates  
- Ensuring consistency for grouping and aggregation operations  

Clean data ensures accuracy and reliability in the subsequent analysis steps.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA phase focuses on answering critical business questions:

### Gender-Based Purchasing Behaviour
Analysis reveals that female customers place more orders and contribute a higher share of revenue. They emerge as a strong target segment during the festive season.

### Age Group Impact
The 26–35 years age group leads in both purchase count and revenue generated. This category typically includes working professionals with higher spending power.

### Occupation Influence
Customers employed in sectors such as IT, Healthcare, and Aviation contribute significantly to total sales. Their stable income patterns align with higher festival spending.

### State-Wise Performance
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka demonstrate the highest purchase volumes and revenue. These regions show strong readiness for festive sales campaigns.

### Product Category Trends
Categories such as Clothing, Food, and Electronics Appliances dominate the sales data. Understanding these trends helps optimize inventory and promotional activities.

## Visual Analysis

The project contains multiple visualizations for better interpretability:

- Bar charts for demographic distribution  
- Count plots for gender and occupation distribution  
- Revenue comparisons across states and age groups  
- Category-wise sales analysis  
- Distribution plots for order counts and spending amounts  

All plots are clearly labelled and presented with the intention of deriving business-focused interpretations.

## Key Insights

- Female customers aged 26–35 form the strongest consumer segment  
- Working professionals in IT, Aviation, and Healthcare show high purchasing activity  
- The top three states by revenue potential are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka  
- Electronics, Clothing, and Food are consistently high-performing product categories  
- Marketing and discount campaigns should prioritize these dominant customer clusters  

These insights help businesses refine their strategy for seasonal sales periods.
